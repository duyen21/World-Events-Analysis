# Welcome to Wolrd Events Analysis April 2022

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/duyen21/World-Events-Analysis/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Problem statement
This page illustrates a set of visualizations and plots to illustrate some
of the current World events, specifically focusing on analyzing current events in Ukraine.

This may include maps of the specific locations of interest,
illustrations of international relations, etc. You will explore and analyze the entities
appearing in the news, as well as their relation. Additionally, you will compare and
contrast various news sources and identify the key similarities and differences between
them.
This time, you take the role of a strategic analyst, and your task is to analyze the current
events in Ukraine. It is a war time; the internet is down, and you donâ€™t have the proper
access to the news sources. However, you have been provided the screenshots of the
news coverage by a foreign intelligence agency. Your superiors are asking you to extract
the data from the images and to analyze the events as they unfold day by day. You are one
of the few people who can do it successfully. World peace depends on you.

## Data processing

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/duyen21/World-Events-Analysis/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
